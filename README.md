# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection Flask App

A deep learning-powered web application to detect plant leaf diseases using image classification. This app helps farmers and agriculturists identify potential plant diseases quickly using a simple, intuitive interface.

## 🧪 About the Project

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built on **MobileNetV2** to classify leaf images into various disease categories. The model is integrated into a **Flask** web app with a clean UI, allowing users to upload leaf images and receive real-time predictions.
